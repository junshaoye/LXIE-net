The repository is for the paper titled "LXIE-net and HLXray: A Mamba-Based Network and Real-World Dataset for Low-Dose X-ray Image Enhancement in Industrial Inspection". 
# 🚀**Introduction**
In industrial inspection, obtaining clear X-ray images typically requires a high dose of radiation. However, this approach has several drawbacks, such as potentially damaging the inspected items, adversely affecting the health of operators, and reducing inspection efficiency due to longer imaging times. Given these issues, how to ensure inspection accuracy while reducing radiation dose has become an urgent problem to solve. One feasible solution is to use image enhancement techniques to improve the quality of low-dose images so that they can achieve the same level of clarity as high-dose images. Nevertheless, existing methods, such as those based on Transformer architectures, struggle to balance capturing global information (which is crucial for accurate industrial inspection) and reducing the consumption of computational resources. In addition, existing datasets lack real-world paired low- and high-dose images, which is a significant limitation for training relevant models. For example, some low-dose images are generated by artificially adding noise to real high-dose images. Therefore, although these methods can achieve high accuracy on existing datasets, applying them to real industrial inspection scenarios still faces many challenges. To address the problems in both methods and datasets mentioned above, this paper proposes a low-dose X-ray image enhancement network (LXIE-net) specifically for industrial inspection, as well as a large-scale dataset named HLXray, which contains real captured paired high- and low-dose X-ray images.

The code and dataset will be made publicly available after our paper is accepted.

# 📊**Datasets**
We have collected and released a real-world X-ray image dataset, named HLXray, comprising 2130 pairs of low-dose and high-dose X-ray images (a total of 4260 images) with a resolution of . Each image within HLXray is derived from authentic scenarios, in which 400 pairs are accompanied by professional annotations detailing three types of defects. As far as we know, it is the first dataset that contains paired low-dose and high-dose X-ray images without any simulated data.
